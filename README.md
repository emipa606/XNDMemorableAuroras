# **Overview**

Ever thought that it was strange that the +14 moodlet from seeing a beautiful aurora just instantly vanishes as soon as a colonist steps indoors; that the spectacular image of this phenomenon just leaves their minds in a puff of smoke as if it were nothing?

This is a simple mod that makes auroras lift your colonists' spirits for an entire day after witnessing an aurora, in the form of a lasting +5 moodlet - just as if they had dined in a very impressive dining room. Auroras now actually mean something for colonists that don't spend 24 hours of the day outdoors!

# **Compatibility**

**Mods:**
There are no known incompatibilities.

**Saves:**
Should be safely addable to existing savegames. Can be removed from existing savegames without issue, though all pawns will lose any 'Observed aurora' thoughts.
